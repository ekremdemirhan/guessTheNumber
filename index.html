        <p id="gameDescription" style="font-size:100%;">In that game, your goal is find out target number that chosen by the game itself.
            You are given 3 hints at the beginning of the game.<br><br>
            <b>(+)</b> sign denotes that; guess contains a digit which is also contanied by the target number and it's on the correct place.
            And <b>(-)</b> sign denotes that; guess contains a digit which is also contanied by the target number and it's on the wrong place. <br><br>
            Let's say, the target number ,which is chosen by randomly, <b>3467</b>. If you try 1234 as guess, the game says that<br> <b>1234 --</b>.
            Both, target number and guess, contain 3 and 4 digits. However, they are on wrong place. On the other hand, 9017 as guess gives user <b>9017 +</b>.
            Because both, target number and guess, just contain 7 and its place is correct.
